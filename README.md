This is a prototype of lego mechanism where you can snap cuboids together to make interesting 3D shapes.

* You can move around and place or delete cuboids in the scene.
* You can change the color of the next cuboid by pressing 'C'.
* You can change the shape by scrolling mouse wheel. At present there are only 3 type of cuboids available but you can extend it as you please.
